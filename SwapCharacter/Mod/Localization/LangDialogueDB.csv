Do I sound that old already?",,,

You could've called me big sister at least...",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/017,Text,Lucy,,Tell me about it.,,,

Hm?",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/019,Text,Lucy,,"The incident, what happened? 
Or is that too personal to share? ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/020,Text,,,"*Charite
Oh no, absolutely not. 
It happened a couple years ago.",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/021,Text,,,"*Charite
Back then I was still on training under Lian. Our fighting style are uncomplementary to say the least. 
She kept nagging me about it which made me completely deaf to any of her advice. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/022,Text,,,"*Charite
Even when her tips were legitimates, I didn't listen out of habbit. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/023,Text,,,"*Charite
One day while we were out scouting, a squad of strong enemies surprised us.  And while she disliked my attitude, Lian trusted me enough to allow me to take the frontline alongside her. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/024,Text,,,"*Charite
I was keeping up well if I'm being honest, until my lack of proper maintenance came back to me.",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/025,Text,,,"*Charite
A joint broke down and the blade lost all its strenght. 
Thanksfuly, Lian saved me and borrowed me enough time to retreat to the rear. She did give me an heavy scolding latter. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/026,Text,,,"*Charite
Our relationship has not changed much since then, neither did our fighting style.
But I've stopped seeing her as a nagging teacher and reflected back on why she gave me these advices in the first place. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/027,Text,,,"*Charite
I've realised she's right even if her teaching method don't speak well to me. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/028,Text,Lucy,,You still don't talk to her after she saved you? ,,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/029,Text,,,"*Charite
For my defence, she doesn't talk to me much either.
Some people are just incompatible, I'm grateful for her teachings and her action this day but there's nothing we can do about not being on the same wavelength.",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/030,Text,Lucy,,I'm sure you could come to like each other if you tried differently. ,,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/031,Text,,,"*Charite
I don't known, both her and I have implicitely agreed to keep our relationship... professional. 
It's the best way for us to prevent fights.",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/032,Text,Lucy,,"Still, I'm sure you could be better friends if your tried! ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv2/033,Text,,,"*Charite
You're sweet Lucy, but that's just how it is. 
You'll get it once you grow older, there's some people you just can't get along with. ",,,

What about it?",,,

Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/004,Text,,,"*Charite
Oh, it's a custom built by Leryn. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/005,Text,,,"*Charite
It doesn't really do anything, it's just here to trick the enemy into attacking it.",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/006,Text,Lucy,,Do the enemies not realise that they're hitting nothing?,,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/007,Text,,,"*Charite
I'm not sure. I think the corruption from the black fog made them much more aggressive and less inteligent. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/008,Text,,,"*Charite
Any smart guy would realise it after one hit. ",,,
Dialogue/FS_SwapChar_Lv3/009,Text,Lucy,,...,,,
